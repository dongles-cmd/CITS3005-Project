Run init.py from the project root directory to:
- Generate OWL ontology for the ifixit database.
- Populate the ontology.
- Check SHACL constraints.

By default init.py will run with minimal output, use -v for verbose output and breaks between each process.
Use -a to also run the application after initializing the knowledge graph.

Please read the user manual before using the app.
