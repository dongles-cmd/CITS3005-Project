Run init.py from the project root directory to:
- Generate OWL ontology for the ifixit database
- Populate the ontology
- Check SHACL constraints
- Launch the applications

By default init.py will run with minimal output, use -inspectionmode for verbose output and breaks between each process

Please read the user manual before using the app
